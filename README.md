# Weather Forecast App
A simple weather forecast webapp design which displays the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast with a city search function. Built with a weather API and JavaScript, then deployed on Netlify.

## Features  
- Search function - powered by weather api (JS + Axios)
- Current temperature, wind speed, humidity and weather description
- 5-day forecast designed with Google Material symbols & grid layout

## Installation  
Clone the repository and install the required packages:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/chardi90/weather.git  
cd weather
pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` 

## Usage  

You may want to research alternative weather apis. This project currently uses:
[SheCodes Weather API](https://www.shecodes.io/learn/apis/weather)

- API key required

## Development Ideas

If I were to develop this project further I would:
1. Make the design responsive for mobile
2. Build withint a ReactJS framework
